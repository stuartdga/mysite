We are trying to build applications that run right in a dozen browsers, look good on thousands of different devices, load fast enough for impatient commuters in the subway, and are still accessible enough that blind people can use them. That’s why Website Test Automation is a critical part of enabling Continuous Integration. Selenium is an open source API for automating website testing. It supports all major browsers and runs on various platforms in many languages. Selenium is used for test automation by companies such as Google, ThoughtWorks, Mozilla, Accenture, Groupon, LinkedIn and IBM. This presentation will explain what Selenium is (for those who don’t know), where Selenium sits in the Continuous Integration feedback loop and how to scale tests written with Selenium using the Selenium Grid. We’ll create tests using scale them across different browsers using node.js and Visual Studio Code.

Are you building Web API’s yet? If you haven’t, you probably will. I have been actively working on Web API’s since 2009 using various technologies. This discussion will focus on using ASP.NET’s Web API and design approaches for building them. I also cover some of the technical challenges that you need to overcome to make your API consumable whether it be private or public. My talks are always hands-on, so both coding and tools are included in the demonstrations.
