Iâ€™ve just released version 1.0 of Selenium Helper for .NET. This project is a simple framework for creating Selenium tests using the Selenium WebDriver and the Selenium Grid.

Although I think that Selenium is pretty easy to use, this framework makes it even easier for novice developers or testers new to .NET. It reduces the amount of effort to get a website test project up and running. To add it to your .NET test project, simply find it on NuGet or from the Package Manager console enter _Install-Package Selenium.Helper_. The framework works with Selenium running locally or remotely on a Selenium Grid.

The source is posted on Github at [https://github.com/stuartdga/SeleniumHelper](https://github.com/stuartdga/SeleniumHelper).
The source includes a test project that has examples of how to use the framework in your test project.
