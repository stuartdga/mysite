Haven’t been able to post for a while. Let me share what’s been eating my spare time (not counting tennis). I started the
year off volunteering for my local Technology Council as chairman of the Education & Outreach committee again. We visited
two high schools, helping students understand what a career in “IT” really means. Both trips were very, very awesome. Then I
coordinated our annual scholarship program , getting student applicants from all of our regional universities and colleges
in an IT major. We beat last year’s number of applicants and are awarding 12 scholarships in June. Then we planned a summer
code camp to be held on the campus of one of our corporate sponsors. We literally filled the camp in a day, where as last
year I was begging for students to attend. The camp is a full one-week scholarship with meals included.

But the biggest thing that I have been fortunate to be involved in is planning a 1-day developer conference to be held here
in Chattanooga. The conference, [Scenic City Summit](http://www.sceniccitysummit.com), will be held on the campus of our local
university, UTC. We’re bringing in a handful of speakers from across the country.
Our theme is quality, not quantity. It’s been a great learning experience.

We’ve gotten a lot of support from sponsors. Registration will begin next week so if we hit our numbers we should have a
little money left over to begin planning an even bigger event next year. But I don’t want to get ahead of myself. I’ll write
an update later and let you know how it went.
