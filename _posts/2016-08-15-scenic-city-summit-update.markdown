The inaugural Scenic City Summit was held on Friday, August 12 on UTCâ€™s campus.  Over 175 attendees participated
during the day to deliver a significant learning experience to the IT community. The Summit filled a void in this area
left by the former Devlink conference The event was sponsored by TEKsystems, CA Technologies, CODE Magazine, CTS,
Carbon Five, Zycron, Progress, Modis, Unum, Dynamo, Co Lab, UTC and Jet Brains.  Speakers fromall over the country
presented a great array of topics, including functional programming, microservices and JavaScript.

I was one of four organizers for this event.  I learned an awful lot and appreciate anyone who volunteers their
personal time to host an event.  We have decided that we definitely plan to have a 2017 event that we hope will be
even bigger and better!
