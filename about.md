I’ve had a great career in IT. I’m not the kid that started coding on a Mac or PC and I didn’t grow up on games. I grew up in a very small town in Alabama and had to start working part-time since the age of 14. My breakthrough came early in my career when the mainframe programmers gave me the PC network to manage because it was far beneath their pay-scale (we know how that story turned out). That was where I hit pay dirt and I’ve never looked back!

I’ve held a number of different positions: programmer, systems, network and database administrator (don’t miss being on-call!), project manager and partner of a small consulting firm. But development has always been my calling. Developing in today’s environment is about as exciting as it can get!

I love sharing what I know and learn with others. And I especially love teaching kids about how great it is to work in IT.
